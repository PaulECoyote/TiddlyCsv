# TiddlyCsv
TiddlyCsv is a lightweight, low-ceremony csv processing library.

## Features
* Reads from stream are asyncronous
* Reads values
* Skips Rows
* Passes code analysis with all Microsoft rules on (with a few justifications in source).
* Only references Microsoft.CSharp, System, System.Core
* XUnit test project
** ... though could do with some more tests in there.

## Ideas for future
* Read rows
* Read entire document in to list of lists of strings (to allow for variable column lengths)
* Read in to strongly typed collection of columns
